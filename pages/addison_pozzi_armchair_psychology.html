<p>God forgive me I might be a champagne socialist.</p>
<p>My mother used to tell me she’d shoot me in the foot</p>
<p>If I ever went into the military.</p>
<p>I used to say back, “Ma, I love that you think Obama made me patriotic”.</p>
<p>My predisposition to theatrics is making this difficult.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>I want to tell you simply what’s happening.</p>
          <p>I live on the border of two counties</p>
          <p>Named God complex and involuntarily celibate.</p>
          <p>And nothing is more dreadful to see</p>
          <p>Then a note to myself in the morning.</p>
        </div>
<br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>You see, we live in a world of other people’s words.</p>
          <p>I spent the summer writing about the rise of primitivism</p>
          <p>But just stopped short of beard oil and ax-throwing bars.</p>
          <p>Last week, I saw a man dragging around a bag</p>
          <p>Of broken dancer’s feet.</p>
          <p>Everything’s a sign when I don’t know what I’m looking for.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
          <p>When mania climbs through my window,</p>
          <p>I align with the colored illustration of a woman</p>
          <p>Stomping bare bloody feet on broken glass</p>
          <p>And declaring she is Leonardo Divinci.</p>
          <p>My therapist calls these delusions of grandeur</p>
          <p>Remedying medication and sleep</p>
          <p>But, frankly, why would I kill the feeling</p>
          <p>That I could kick God in the shins?</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>I’m making an argument.</p>
          <p>When I die, give my blood plasma to the junkies,</p>
          <p>Bury my cynicism with plastic flowers,</p>
          <p>And let my headstone read,</p>
          <p>“Here lies a white male self-aggrandizing intellectual</p>
          <p>That tried to marginalize himself as much as possible.”</p>
          <p>But don’t forget to send out thank-you notes to everyone</p>
          <p>Who thought any better of me.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="stanza">
          <p>Last week, I bought a book called Make Time for Creativity.</p>
          <p>I got high, read it in one sitting, and decided to get high again.</p>
          <p>My laziness sometimes buys me gifts.</p>
