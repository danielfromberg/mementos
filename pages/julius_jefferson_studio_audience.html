<p>On the night before my audition, I watched this melodrama that my sister was on.</p>
<br>
<p>“Do you love me?” the porcelain actress asked her milquetoast co-star.</p>
<br>
<p>
With melodramas like this, all you have to do is clap and hoot at the beginning, middle, and end. At least that’s how my father used to put it when he was a part of a studio audience. I didn’t notice my sister among the applause for this program but I could recognize her hoot. It was really throaty since she smoked a pack a day.</p>
<br>
<p>
The actor looked away as he confessed to his partner, “Yes, my darling,” he looked up at her and added on, “My love for you is so strong, it can melt the mightiest piece of steel.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
A wave of “Awws” and “Hoots” with a lone “Hollar” followed in approval. I think my sister did the Hollar this time, which is very generous considering how much she bagged on this show.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“It’s the same awful lovey-dovey garbage over and over again. Which is fine as long as it pays but god I would be so offended if I was a writer,” my sister said before taking another hit of her cigarette, “Honestly, I have thought about taking up writing because of this show. Clearly it’s not that hard!”
</p>
<br>
<p>

Alex just didn’t get it, she never got it. She got that way of thinking from our dad. While I can realize that the writer is obviously in on the joke and is just writing this ‘lovey-dovey garbage’ since he loves doing it. Many spectators have become performers and some performers have even become writers. But once you’re a writer, you never want to be anything else. Something my dad hated was how spectators could never become writers. The way he would tell it, nobody has developed a better sense of standards for good entertainment than a seasoned spectator. My dad was one for his entire life and Alex had been one for five years now.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  As the credits rolled, my boyfriend Tommy called me on the phone, “I wasn’t expecting you to still be up.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Alex was in the crowd for the late-night taping of ‘Lovers Stone.’” I asked him, “How’s the tour for that 9/11 film going? Has it messed with your sleeping?”

</p>
<br>
<p>

“Don’t worry, love. I’ve been sleeping like a baby.”

</p>
<br>
<p>
  Tommy was a performer and as much as he said he hated it, he would make sure to remind me every second. A teenage heartthrob who won the hearts of millions with his singing and earned the respect of another million with his hard-boiled portrayal of tortured war veterans. Sometimes his talents would cross over in award-winning films like the 2043 musical “Sing! Dance! Vietnam!” That was the first time I ever saw Tommy. I got kicked out of the theater cause I couldn’t stop crying during his finale where I waited outside in the rain for the next showing. You couldn’t find someone more handsome. His dark curly afro that your fingers could get lost in. Tall and warm, staring up at his endlessly sad, blue eyes. I wrote one of those obsessed, psychotic fan letters where you swear you’ve watched every live taping he ever performed in. My sister Alex made fun of me for days until I received a handwritten response from him. I smelled the envelope for what felt like hours and yeah, it just smelled like paper, but at that moment, it’s what he smelled like to me. We wrote to each other, back and forth, the whole summer, sharing dreams, secrets, and nightmares that we told nobody else.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I rolled my eyes and told him, “I don’t have to sleep that much anyway. Alex swears that it’s just showing off that I can emote or whatever. Easy peasy.”</p>
<br>
<p>

  “You gotta take it more seriously. You don’t wanna end up like one of those hacks who audition year-after-year with no shot of ever making it. I could never stand being around someone like that.”
</p>
<br>
<p>“If I don’t get it today, I’ll just have more time to focus on writing fan letters for performers. Maybe I could even start writing your fan letters.”
</p>
<br>
<p>“I’m never firing Nicole, Laurie. And you can do so much better than writing my fan letters. There’s nobody who understands our work better than you. Any program would be so lucky to have you in its audience.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
I had just turned 19 the week before and I genuinely believed that I would never meet someone sweeter to me than Tommy. Despite his hatred of performing, he fully accepted my fascination with what so many disregarded as propaganda trash. This trash was the most attractive source of escapism for our grandparents and their parents and so on. Hated your job? Go to the movie theater and imagine yourself as a secret spy. Your heart got broken? Listen to someone beautiful sing something to wrap your feelings with. No friends? Turn on the computer and find some in a virtual world of anarchy and chaos. Tired of your family? Stay in your room and watch as many episodes as you can of people being absolutely terrible to each other. We may have evolved past our need for entertainment but I think it’s a little admirable that our government refuses to let it go. And since they can’t, we can’t either. There was nothing that made us feel more beautiful than beauty itself.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I never felt proud of my work until I talked to you about it,” Tommy said, “And I will be happy to do it as long as you’re watching. Now get some rest cause you’re gonna do great.”
</p>
<br>
<p>

  A real heartthrob. I ended the call and decided to give myself the sleep that Tommy said I deserved. There were no dreams or nightmares. I closed my eyes and five hours passed when they opened a second after. Thanks to writing fan letters for the A-listers, I stayed in a fairly priced studio apartment next to the studios where they produced a lot of sitcoms. It was a box at times but whenever Alex or Tommy visited, it felt like home. In the morning, I took a short shower, brushed my teeth, prepped my hair for the day. I decided to go with this neon blue bob as I’ve been very lucky with it lately. Some people thought I was a pop star when I wore it on my date with Tommy the week before. I secretly hoped it could strengthen my emoting since it was in need of a distraction.</p>
  <br>
<p>
My cry and scream were perfect. I spent weeks practicing it with Alex since a lot of creators liked her for those specifically. My laughing could use a lot of work. I never really liked comedies that much since I always felt they encouraged audiences to be amused whenever someone is mean to you. There are whoopie-cushions with more of a funny bone than Tommy so he never did much to help me laugh. Alex is Alex so it definitely wasn’t difficult for her to crack me up. If only she could have been the one I auditioned for, it wouldn’t have been much of a hassle.</p>
<br>

<p>On my way to the Audition Center, I couldn’t escape those 14 ft high billboards of Tommy’s anguished expression next to the Twin Towers falling. They promoted his latest film “Never Forget 2 The Future.” There were tourists of all kinds who would stop to take selfies with ground-level posters. As if it was a memorial. What’s fucked up is that Tommy is secretly a 9/11 denier which made it even harder to take this ad campaign seriously. It looked like he was more in pain for having to accept something he didn’t believe in than the thousands of people his character failed to save. Audiences all over the world were calling it his strongest performance yet. He played a young veteran named Peyton Jackson who was born in our time but suddenly wakes up on September 10th, 2001. It was the first movie I couldn’t finish by choice. The first 5 minutes are so god-awful and I would rather assume that he just causes 9/11 to be even worse than actually finish watching it. Tommy never minded my negative response since it wasn’t a personal project or anything.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  I was welcomed by a very nice desk lady for the check-in. She had a lot of wrinkles where I wondered who came here first: her or the building. The lady informed me that I have an assigned scene partner who I would meet down in the hallway. Alex warned me many times that this could be the case and honestly, it was a bit of a relief. My dad told me that if I ever had to audition with a partner, and if I was bad, I could blame it on the partner they gave me. So I don’t feel too embarrassed about auditioning a second time without one.
</p>
<br>
<p>

I made my way down the hallway and a cold chill ran through me when I first saw Chloe. Her olive skin, long silky blonde hair with the right side shaved short. She had on a disguise that could have cracked me up if I wasn’t so nervous. A combo of black eyeliner, glitter, and black lipstick that gave off a “don’t-dare-mess-wit-me” persona. She wore a black jumpsuit and a pair of navy blue converse. If she wasn’t so deep in her thoughts, she would have noticed me staring before I sat next to her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hi. Are you here for the 2:15 audition?”</p>
<br>
<p>
Chloe looked up and down at me as if my outfit could give any clues. I decided to not do much make-up that day and decided to just go with a white T-shirt, jeans, and white adidas. As plain as I could be as an audience member since I’ll be in the shadows.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yup. We must be scene partners,” she said and extended her hand to me, “Chloe Arnold.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Shocked, I shook her hand and asked, “Chloe Arnold?”</p>
<br>
<p>
Chloe rolled her eyes and said, “Yeah yeah, only daughter of Madam Arnold. Please try to not make a big deal out of it.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’ll try. Your get-up makes more sense now.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yeah, I wasn’t really in the mood to be recognizable today. Getting hassled by those pervs with their cameras.”</p>
<br>
<p>
She turned away immediately after sharing that with me, as deep in her thoughts as she was before. The Arnolds were the last family allowed to have their own reality TV show. Beloved by millions for pushing traditional family values alongside some “humorous hi-jinks.” Chloe stopped appearing on the program when she turned 16 and attempted to run away with her boyfriend at the time. This turn warped the Arnolds’ fame for the worst as it made those same millions realize that this government approved reality was as false as any other piece of programming they gave us. Where Chloe received most of the harsh feedback since her attempt to escape the looking glass broke it for everyone else. Tommy disliked talking about her as she made him and any other performer feel like a coward for not speaking out or showing support. I found her admirable and would never have expected to ever see her in the flesh, let alone be her scene partner.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Hey,” Chloe said as she turned back to me, “You never told me your name.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“Laurie. Laurie Bjornsen if you need my full name.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“I don’t.”</p>
<br>
<p>
Down the hallway, a door opened and the average head of an average man poked out and looked at us.</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Laurie and Chloe,” he said, “My name is Riggs and you’ll be auditioning for me today. Please come in.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Chloe and I shared a mildly disturbed glance and we stood up to join Riggs for our audition. The office was real bland and had a wall full of framed pictures. Each one
  had Riggs grinning real big with a celebrity. He even had one with Tommy that almost got me giggling. I was thankful for the janky ceiling fan he had on as it would have been too quiet in this already suspicious room.</p>
<br>
<p>
Riggs had me and Chloe sit side-by-side on these wooden stools. He hummed and hummed a tune I never heard of and handed a one-page script to Chloe. She went straight to absorbing each and every line as if she had something to prove. Riggs was occupied reading what I guess was my resume while I had to wait for either of these nutcases to say something.</p>
<br>
<p>
  His eyebrow rose and then his eyes darted over at me. Riggs asked, “Laurie Bjornsen?” I looked up and he didn’t even give me a chance to answer.
  “Are you the daughter of Christopher Bjornsen?”</p>
<br>
<p>
Nervous, I glanced at Chloe and noticed she was staring at me too.</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Don’t look at her,” Riggs commanded, “Can you answer my questions?”
  I nodded. This made Riggs’s expression twist into a perverse grin as he chuckled.
  “Your father was one of the best spectators I worked with,” he set the document down on his desk, not breaking his stare into my soul, “I hope what you show to me today will be a fair resemblance of what he was able to accomplish.”</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  My voice shrunk and hid at the edge of my throat. I just stared and nodded at him again.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Could you give a vocal confirmation?” Riggs asked, “I hope they didn’t send me another mute failson.”</p>
<br>
<p>
I found my voice and responded, “Yes. I will do my best for you, sir.”</p>
<br>
<p>
  I glanced over at Chloe again and saw her expression turned from bothered to awfully sad. I felt terrible for having her make such a face knowing what could already be on her mind.</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Alright,” Riggs grumbled, “I think we’re ready to start. You’re gonna stay in that chair, Laurie. You stand up, Chloe. Do you have the lines memorized?”</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Not yet,” she said.</p>
<br>
<p>
Riggs sighed and said, “It’s fine. I guess. Sure. We can just use the page today.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“If you give me another minute, I can be ready.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“I don’t have it, Chloe. Get up already, we’ll just use the page today since you’re not serious about it.”</p>
<br>
<p>
Chloe got up from her chair with her page and stood right next to Riggs. It was amusing seeing how taller Chloe was then this guy. He had on a pearl dress-up shirt with his sleeves rolled up and the top open so we could see his chest hairs. An expensive platinum watch on his wrist to upscale his clean khakis and dress shoes. He turned to Chloe, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and opened his eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Let’s get this over with. I’ll start.”</p>
<br>
<p>
Chloe nodded.</p>
<br>
<p>
In a confused tone, Riggs asked, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m here for the same reason as everyone else is,” Chloe responded, “To Work.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“Yes. That’s obvious.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“I need to support—”</p>
<br>
<p>
Riggs interrupted her, turned to me, dry expression, and said, “Laugh.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“Excuse me,” I said.</p>
<br>
<p>
“This shit ain’t free, Laurie. I said something funny. So laugh.”</p>
<br>
<p>
As if I needed my audition to start this way, I did my best and gave him a chuckle. This didn’t please Riggs at all so I looked over at Chloe who still looked sad.</p>
  <br>
<p>
  “Why are you looking at her?” Riggs asked, “I’m the funny one here. Laugh at me.”</p>
<br>
<p>
  And I tried to chuckle some more. Which just made him ask for more. And his tone was getting more hostile as he wanted more. So I chuckled even harder, creating a rhythm of them to resemble the laughter he could be looking for. Once I had something that got close, he immediately told me to stop. And returned to Chloe, telling her to continue. Which she went right into.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I got two kids, boss. Two of them. And they’re absolute rascals, but they’re my rascals you know?”</p>
<br>
<p>“I can imagine.”</p>
<br>
<p>
Chloe carried on, “They’re rascals, boss. A heaping case of double trouble. But they’re mine. And I love them to death.”</p>
<br>
<p>
  A sick smile formed on Riggs’s face as he gave Chloe a brief applause. He told her, “I’m sure they’re lucky to have a mother like you.” And then he turned to me and asked, “Wasn’t that adorable?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
At that point, I knew I should keep my eyes off of Chloe and keep them on this guy. I answered, “Yes, it was a very sweet moment.”</p>
<br>
<p>
“God fucking dammit,” Riggs takes the script from Chloe and tosses it, “That’s not what we wanted to hear!”</p>
<br>
<p>
“It’s adorable, Laurie! We already know that,” Riggs said, “You don’t talk to adorable things. Anybody who ever watched any piece of programming knows that. You ‘aw’ at them. Give us a long ‘aw.’”</p>
<br>
<p>No choice. I gave him a very long awwwwwwww.</p>
<br>
<p>
Riggs, no reaction, turned back to Chloe and ordered her to continue with her next line.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Now give me my damn time card so I get these kids everything they want for Christmas.”</p>
<br>
<p>
  Riggs gave Chloe another thing of applause and said aloud, “Mother of the year! Laurie! Applaud, goddammit!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
And I clapped. And clapped until it sounded like applause.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Where’s the enthusiasm? What the fuck is that, Laurie?”</p>
<br>
<p>
And I applauded faster. Applauded harder. With more spirit by the second.</p>
<br>
<p>
  “Can you believe this piece of shit right here, Chloe? This motherfucker is clapping like he wants like his deadbeat father is still around to make him forget what an embarrassment he is!”
</p>
<br>
<p>
I applauded. And applauded. And applauded.</p>
<br>
<p>
“Now that’s more like it! Clap like it’ll bring daddy back! Give us a woo or something!”</p>
<br>
<p>
  I clapped and clapped and gave him a woo. And he asked for a louder one and I gave it to him louder.
</p>
<br>
<p>“You love it, don’t ya, Laurie?”</p>
<br>
<p>
  I exclaimed my love over and over as I kept on applauding Chloe for her performance. I didn’t know I could love something so much before. This was the greatest thing I ever witnessed in my life. Greater than Alex. Greater than Tommy. Greater than Sing! Dance! Vietnam! And I needed Riggs to know how much I loved this performance. So I applauded as long as my hands would let me. They were stinging and pink, felt like they could explode any second, but it still wasn’t enough. I wooed and announced my love for Chloe’s performance over and over. As she tried to fight back her tears as if I wasn’t giving her the best tribute that her talent deserved at this very moment. My hands kept on smacking each other and Riggs kept on shouting at me. I finally understood my reason for existing.
</p>

<p>
To make the beautiful ones feel beautiful. To make the beautiful ones feel beautiful. To make the beautiful ones feel beautiful.
