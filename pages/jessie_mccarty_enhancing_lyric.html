        <ol>
       <p>Call me weak, in some way.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p> This is what he said to me.

       </p>
        <br>
       <p> This is what he said to me, as he lay coughing, fidgeting, squirming, crying.       </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is what the love of my heart, lock, key, bars, jail, cage, bubble balloon, whispered in a tangential whisper into my outer ear
            when I killed him. And what were we both wearing? Rugs made from fine materials, our feelings sitting in a pile of cut hair. But
            don’t look at me. I did not make him cut his hair. He did this on his own. Long and brown and to the waist. No one had curls like
            the love of my polyester rug bubbled up skin tight scared and crying boy-friend. And he was, my friend. He was! How could he
            not be? He had a laugh like a small animal, shy but louder as the evening goes. He baked us brie, before the event, a cheese I
            loathe. Do you know about the history of brie? He is asking me. This surprised me, you know, as it’s usually me to be the
            narrator of an object's life. This is the life of brie: named after the mother he was born under in Northern France: brie took five
            to six weeks to grow out of age. He is not sharp nor does he offer structure. Presenting himself with a grey-tone, he soaks in
            skim or whole cow’s milk just until heat warms him to exactly 99 degrees Fahrenheit. His guardians throw him in molds. Take
            him out. Salt him, dress him for graduation, and off he goes. My boy-friend is now cutting me a slice, as he tells me this,
            pushing the correct wine to pair and encouraging me to eat. But my soul is not hungry. You are now wondering: how did he die
            from blissful brie honeymooning to pleading on the floor? I don’t know either, because I suffer from anaesthesia, everything
            makes me forget. You might assume this is a good thing, but it is not. I do not know why he called himself weak. Maybe I urged
            him to. Maybe I made him when I tied up his ankles, his hands, his thighs and forced him to shave his head. Maybe I laughed
            when he got scared, and asked me to pass the bread and his dairy. Maybe I didn’t like being underestimated. Maybe I do not
            like to be unseen. Because that is what you do when you cannot see our power. When you do not see us, you do not think we
            have the capability. But I can, you can call me strong.        </p>
    <br>
        <p>
            He asks, in what way? That’s when I hit him.

    <div id="stanza">
<p>I have a home suffering from darkness.</p>
<p>Home received his diagnoses after a prolonged series of rest.</p>
<p>This is what we call our good period.</p>
<br>
<p>There is no light left, not in House, no.</p>
<p>Not where Rug sits or where Bamboo dries.</p>
<p>Also, there now lies a draft.</p>
<p>Draft, House says, understands the darkness.</p>
<p>He rushes in when I'm asleep, he says.</p>
<p>Through the window each</p>
<p>Ponder the next move, amid my study</p>
<p>amid my oak desk.</p>
<br>
<p>The lack of light in Home</p>
<p>The lack of warmth in Draft</p>
<p>Make them a menace.</p>
<p>I understand suffering causes everyone to suffer,</p>
<p>But I won't have it any longer.</p>
<p>They plot to hurt me further, this I believe.</p>
<p>Any sense of our solidarity is artificial: we are at war with another.</p>
<p>The winner wants happiness, however we’ll buy it.</p>
<br>
<p>Home is jealous of my lamps, so he short circuits them.</p>
<p>When he is silent, I too attack.</p>
<p>By attack, I mean I make myself comfortable.</p>
<p>I light a hot fire,</p>
<p>I use cable outlets until they spark,</p>
<p>I watch loud television, I seal my doors</p>
<p>My Windows, shutters.</p>
<br>
<p>But it is no use.</p>
<p>What is mine is not mine, it is theirs.</p>

<p>When I emerged from the small womb a canary built for me, I was surprised to find no wings along my spine.
</p>
<br>
<p>What do I call myself? Mother canary had no recognition of my breed, for I resemble no bird or reptile nor a mammal or fish.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    And yet she calls me a child.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    As her child I was to stand close by. Bird or not, my natural form is a threat to others: my throat loud and my skin slimy. I am a
    natural guardian of our nest when she flies off for lunch. It was a crisis when we noticed worms only made me weaker. We
    found my taste for bones is vast. My insides melt them. She is scared, and yet she feeds me.
</p>
<br>
<p>Now I am grown, with a womb of my own. My mother, who resembled a red petal in summer, is no longer here. My child is a
    creature I have never known. I worry I cursed her. I too am a Mother, and I am lost.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    And yet I love her, like a canary loved me.
